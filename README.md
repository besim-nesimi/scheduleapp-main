# Getting started

The project may work in various degrees in various NodeJS versions, but the project is currently developed for NodeJS version 16.

As a first step when setting up the project you will need to install all dependencies. You might not be prompted by the system to run npm audit fix everytime, but if you are please do so:

```bash
cd admin && npm install && npm audit fix && cd .. && cd schedule-data-service && npm install && npm audit fix && cd .. && npm install && npm audit fix
```

Next you will want to build the application (our admin dashboard built by utilising React-Admin) for production:

```bash
cd admin && npm run build && cd ..
```

To get the application up and running, please use this command:

```bash
npm run dev
```


To rebuild and restart, do this...  
CTRL+C twice in the terminal to stop the server, then...

```bash
clear && cd admin && npm run build && cd .. && npm run dev
```
